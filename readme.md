# NG-CanaryHunter 
It is an advanced assessment network scanning tool designed for security professionals to detect and interact with canary devices, such as Thinkst Canary or T-Pot, while minimizing the risk of detection.

# Features of NG-CanaryHunter 
Advanced Scanning Techniques: Utilizes sophisticated methods like IPv6 extension header scans, custom payload TCP scans, fingerprinting, timing analysis, and protocol anomaly detection.
Stealth Mode: Operates in an invisible mode using encrypted payloads to blend with legitimate traffic, reducing the chances of detection.
Flexible Targeting: Supports single IPs, CIDR notation, multiple IPs, and domain resolution.
Harmless Simulation: Includes a harmless mode to simulate benign user behavior.
Hunting Capabilities: Option to hunt for secrets and tripwires after detection.

# Scanning Techniques as Pre-Step
NG-CanaryHunter uses very unsual method to scan and generate legitimate network traffic.

# Detection of Canary as Pre-Step
NG-CanaryHunter provides security professionals with a powerful and discreet tool for identifying security traps and tripwires in a network. Its advanced techniques and stealth capabilities ensure thorough and undetected security assessments, enhancing the overall security posture.

# Algorithms to Deafeat Canaries
Dynamic Payload Generation: Use more complex, dynamically changing payloads that are less likely to be fingerprinted by defensive systems.
Random Timing Delays: Introduce random timing delays between packet sends to mimic human behavior and evade rate-based detection systems.
Packet Fragmentation: Use packet fragmentation to sneak past simple packet inspection systems that do not properly reassemble packets.
Polymorphic Code: Change the code structure dynamically, making the scanning activity harder to detect via static signatures.
Protocol Obfuscation: Implement techniques to modify protocol headers in ways that are still compliant but might confuse security devices.
Stealth by Confusion: Use decoy traffic that appears legitimate to distract from the scanning activities.
